# TaskTimer

An app that stores data in a SQLite database. A Task Timer App that we can use to record how long to spend on different tasks. It’s useful if you have to complete time sheets for your work for example. Databases will have separate tables to stores the task that we’ll be timing and timing’s themselves. Delete associated records in a joined table. Another thing that this app will need to do is record and display dates, using the java calendar classes to do that. User can download the app from almost any where in the world, and it’s very easy to mess up when dealing different time zones. So we implemented how to safely deal with time across the world in the apps. In this app editing a task record on a phone will show a different screen because there just isn’t enough room on a phone’s display. But on a tablet, user will be able to edit the task details alongside the lists of tasks. The first thing we do is provide the user with basic information on how to use the app when they first run it. Heading shows which task is currently being timed. If you are building a customer for this task or any of the task, and you probably wouldn’t be interested in charging for every second, so stop timing that. For that go into settings and have got options here to ignore timings for task that last less than certain amount of time. The settings menu lets us to choose which day a week start on. Some companies start on a Sunday when they’re doing accounting, others start on a Monday. It display report of how long was spent on each task, including task name, date and description. We can view a full week data. Using a button that’s a switch between displaying a whole week tasks or just the current day tasks. So we’ll implement Dates that can display in user preferred format based on their country. The app also have and about dialogue, that provide additional information about the app.
